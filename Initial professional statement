# Professional Statement  

As an elite athlete and former police officerm, I am now pursuing a career in cybersecurity. I have yet to find a niche, but as I learn and grow I will zero in on it. 
I bring discipline and problem-solving skills to the field, and I value integrity, teamwork, and resilience. 
I am motivated to grow my technical expertise to help organizations protect sensitive data and reduce risk.
 

These strengths and values align with my goal of contributing to organizations by safeguarding systems, reducing risks, and supporting a strong security culture.
